# 2DGame

This is a 2D top-down RPG game developed using Unity and C#. The project is structured for development, compilation, and execution on the **Windows** platform. Below are detailed instructions for compiling and running the game, including all necessary prerequisites.

---

## Project Structure
The project directory (`2DGame`) contains the following key components:
- `Assets/`: Contains game assets (sprites, scripts, scenes, etc.).
- `Packages/`: Unity package dependencies.
- `ProjectSettings/`: Unity configuration files.
- `2DGame.sln` and `Assembly-CSharp.csproj`: Solution and project files for C# development.
- `.gitignore` and `.gitattributes`: Git configuration files for version control.
- `Library/`, `Logs/`, `Temp/`, `obj/`: Temporary and cache folders (excluded from version control).

---

## Prerequisites

### General Requirements
- **Unity**: Version 2022.3 or later (LTS recommended for stability). Download from [Unity Hub](https://unity.com/download).
- **Unity Hub**: Central tool for managing Unity projects and editor versions. Download from [Unity Hub](https://unity.com/releases/hub).
- **IDE**: 
  - **Visual Studio Community** (recommended for C# debugging on Windows). Download from [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/).
  - **Visual Studio Code** (alternative, with C# extension). Download from [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and install the C# extension by Microsoft.
- **Git**: For cloning the repository (optional). Download from [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
- **Disk Space**: At least 5GB free for Unity, project files, and build outputs.
- **Operating System**: Windows 10 or later (64-bit).
- **Graphics Drivers**: Ensure GPU drivers are up to date (e.g., NVIDIA, AMD, or Intel) for smooth rendering.
- **DirectX**: Typically pre-installed on Windows 10/11, but ensure DirectX 11 or later is available for Unity’s rendering pipeline.

## How to Compile

### Step 1: Set Up the Project
1. **Clone or Download the Repository**:
   - Using Git (if version control is set up):
   git clone https://github.com/hoangfish/2DGame
- Alternatively, download the `2DGame` folder as a ZIP file and extract it to a desired location.
2. **Install Unity Hub**:
- Download and install Unity Hub from [Unity](https://unity.com/releases/hub).
- Open Unity Hub and sign in with a Unity account (free tier is sufficient for personal use).
3. **Install Unity Editor**:
- In Unity Hub, go to **Installs** > **Install Editor**.
- Select Unity 2022.3 (LTS) or a later version.
- Ensure the **Windows Build Support (IL2CPP)** module is included during installation to enable Windows builds.
- Install the editor to your system (default path is fine).
4. **Open the Project in Unity**:
- In Unity Hub, click **Add** in the **Projects** tab.
- Navigate to the `2DGame` folder and select it.
- Click the project name in Unity Hub to open it in the Unity Editor.
5. **Verify Project Integrity**:
- If assets or references are missing, go to **Assets > Reimport All** in the Unity Editor.
- Check the **Console** window for any C# script compilation errors. Open problematic scripts in Visual Studio or VS Code to resolve.

### Step 2: Compile for Windows
1. **Configure Build Settings**:
- In the Unity Editor, go to **File > Build Settings**.
- Select **PC, Mac & Linux Standalone** as the platform.
- Ensure **Target Platform** is set to **Windows**.
- Set **Architecture** to **x86_64** (64-bit, standard for modern Windows systems).
- Optionally, adjust **Compression Method** (e.g., Default or LZ4HC for faster builds).
2. **Build the Project**:
- In the Build Settings window, click **Build**.
- Choose an output directory (e.g., `Builds/Windows/` in the project folder).
- Unity will compile the project, generating:
- An executable file (e.g., `2DGame.exe`).
- A data folder (e.g., `2DGame_Data`) containing game assets and resources.
- The compilation process may take a few minutes, depending on system performance and project size.
3. **Handle Compilation Errors**:
- If the build fails, check the **Console** for errors (e.g., missing assets, script errors).
- Reimport assets via **Assets > Reimport All** if textures or prefabs are missing.
- Ensure all scripts in `Assets/Scripts/` compile without errors by reviewing them in your IDE.
- If errors persist, verify that the **Windows Build Support** module is installed in Unity Hub.

## How to Run

### Running in Unity Editor
1. **Load a Scene**:
- In the Unity Editor, open the **Hierarchy** window.
- Ensure a valid game scene is loaded (e.g., `Assets/Scenes/SampleScene.unity`). Double-click the scene file in the **Project** window to load it.
2. **Play the Game**:
- After setting up the project (and ensuring compilation in the editor is successful), click the **Play** button (triangle icon) at the top of the Unity Editor.
- The game will run in the **Game** view, allowing you to test gameplay (e.g., use WASD for movement, mouse for aiming, or other controls defined in `Assets/Scripts/PlayerController.cs`).
- Use the **Scene** view to debug or inspect game objects during play.
3. **Stop Playing**:
- Click the **Play** button again to stop the game and return to editing mode.
- Check the **Console** for any runtime errors or warnings during playtesting.

### Running the Built Executable
1. **Locate the Build Output**:
- Navigate to the output directory specified during the build (e.g., `Builds/Windows/`).
- Ensure the executable (`2DGame.exe`) and the accompanying `2DGame_Data` folder are present in the same directory.
2. **Launch the Game**:
-

Double-click `2DGame.exe` to run the game on Windows.
- The game will launch in a standalone window or fullscreen, depending on settings configured in **Edit > Project Settings > Player**.
3. **System Requirements**:
- **OS**: Windows 10 or later (64-bit).
- **RAM**: Minimum 4GB (8GB recommended for smooth performance).
- **GPU**: DirectX 11-compatible graphics card (e.g., NVIDIA GTX 960 or equivalent).
- **Storage**: Approximately 1GB for the built game, depending on assets.

## Troubleshooting
- **Unity Editor Issues**:
- **Missing Assets**: If textures, scripts, or prefabs are missing, go to **Assets > Reimport All**.
- **Script Compilation Errors**: Open the **Console** window to view errors. Edit problematic scripts in Visual Studio or VS Code (check `Assets/Scripts/`).
- **Packages Missing**: Open **Window > Package Manager** and verify all dependencies listed in `Packages/manifest.json` are installed.
- **Build Issues**:
- **Executable Fails to Run**: Ensure the `2DGame_Data` folder is in the same directory as `2DGame.exe`.
- **Graphics Issues**: Update GPU drivers (e.g., via NVIDIA GeForce Experience or AMD Radeon Software).
- **Build Fails**: Check that **Windows Build Support (IL2CPP)** is installed in Unity Hub. Reinstall if necessary.
- **Performance Issues**:
- Enable **V-Sync** in **Edit > Project Settings > Quality** to prevent screen tearing.
- Reduce graphical settings (e.g., lower resolution or disable effects) in **Edit > Project Settings > Player** for low-end systems.
- Use the **Profiler** (Window > Analysis > Profiler) to identify performance bottlenecks during playtesting.
- **Gameplay Issues**:
- If controls don’t work, verify input mappings in `Assets/Input/InputActions.inputactions` or scripts like `PlayerController.cs`.
- Test gameplay in the Unity Editor first to debug issues before building.

## Additional Notes
- **Scripts**: All C# scripts are located in `Assets/Scripts/`. Key files include:
- `PlayerController.cs`: Handles player movement and input.
- `EnemyBase.cs`: Base class for enemy behavior.
- `WeaponFactory.cs`: Manages weapon instantiation.
- **Scenes**: Game scenes are stored in `Assets/Scenes/`. Start with `Sample
